# UNDAW Repository
### Welcome to the repository of UNDAW (Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation Based on the Waserstein Distance)
This is the repository for the method presented in the paper: 
"Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation Based on the Waserstein Distance," 
by [K.
Drossos](https://tutcris.tut.fi/portal/en/persons/konstantinos-drosos(b1070370-5156-4280-b354-6291618bb965).html), 
[P. Magron](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~magron/), and [T. Virtanen](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~tuomasv/). 

Our paper is submitted for review at the [2019 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio 
and Acoustics (WASPAA), Mohonk Mountain House, New Paltz, NY](https://www.waspaa.com/). 

You can find an online version of our paper at arxiv:

##Dependencies, pre-requisites, and setting up the code 
In order to use our code, you have to firstly:
 
* use Python 3.x and install all the required packages listed at the
[requirements.txt file]
* download the data from 
* download the pre-trained non-adapted model from here and the adapted model from here 
(this is optional and is required only in the case that you want to reproduce the 
results of the paper)

Then: 
* place the downloaded data at the directory.
* place the downloaded models at the directory. 

That's it! 

You can either refer to the 
[ reproduce the results of the paper ](#reproduce-the-results-of-the-paper) section for 
reproducing the results presented in our paper, or to the
[ use the code with your own data ](#use-the-code-with-your-own-data) section if you want to
use our code for your own task and/or with your own data. 

Enjoy! 

##Reproduce the results of the paper
To reproduce the results of the paper, you have to:
* make sure that you have followed the steps in the 
[ dependencies, pre-requisites, and setting up the code ](#Dependencies,-pre-requisites,-and-setting up the code)
section
* be at the root directory of the project (i.e. in the ``undaw`` directory)
* issue the following command at your terminal: ``./undaw_paper.sh``
